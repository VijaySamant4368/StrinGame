# StrinGame

StrinGame is a maze-solving game developed purely in Python using the Pygame library. Unlike traditional maze games, StrinGame incorporates a unique mechanic where players are given a brief glimpse of the maze layout before the lights go out. Players must then navigate through the dark maze by entering directional commands (WASD) to move their character. Once the player submits their input, the lights turn back on, revealing their progress and the surroundings.

## Features

- **Dynamic Maze Generation:** Utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to create random maze layouts for each gameplay session.
- **Unique Gameplay Mechanic:** Players must navigate through the dark maze using only directional commands.
- **Customizable Difficulty:** Adjustable parameters allow for tweaking the maze complexity and duration of light exposure.
- **Purely Pure Python Implementation:** Developed entirely using Python libraries, without the need for image or audio files.
